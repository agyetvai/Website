  <p class=paperdet> <i> Abstract: </i> 
  This paper develops a parsimonious framework for modeling job search in occupationally segmented labor markets. I start by documenting that patterns of job-to-job and unemployment-to-job flows vary substantially across occupations. Canonical job search models with homogeneous search frictions cannot explain these job flows, as the simulated patterns would look identical for all occupations. In contrast, my framework allows for heterogeneity in search frictions within and across occupations. I build a job search model in which workers may either climb one of many job ladders, each of which represents an occupation with wage levels as rungs, or may jump from one ladder to another. The heterogeneity in search frictions explodes with the addition of occupations, which poses a challenge for identification and estimation. I overcome this challenge by introducing preference shocks to job search which tie the structural parameters of the model to conditional choice probabilities of accepting offers. On top of search frictions and preference shocks, occupational job flow patterns may also arise from compensating differentials and switching costs, and may differ across unobserved worker types. Taking my model to rich administrative data from Hungary, I show that occupational heterogeneity in search frictions, compensating differentials, and switching costs explains the observed job flows. The general framework in this paper is readily applicable to model job search in arbitrarily segmented labor markets.

  <p class=paperdet> <i> Abstract: </i> 
  In this paper we propose a new method to estimate continuous-time job search models. Our approach is based on an adaptation of the conditional choice probability estimation methods to a continuous time job search environment. To do so, the proposed framework incorporates preference shocks into the search framework, resulting in a tight connection between value functions and conditional choice probabilities. A key advantage of the proposed approach relative to standard estimation methods for continuous-time job search models is computational. In particular, this makes it possible to estimate rich nonstationary job search models without having to solve any differential equation, and in some cases even avoiding any optimization. We apply our method to analyze the effect of unemployment benefit expiration on the duration of unemployment using rich longitudinal data from Hungarian administrative records.
