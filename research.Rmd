  <!-- <p class=paperdet> <i> Abstract: </i>  -->
  <!-- This paper assesses the impact of occupational mobility on life cycle wage inequality. -->
  <!-- I develop a model of job mobility which attributes differential returns to occupations to occupationally heterogeneous labor market frictions, compensating differentials, and non-pecuniary job switching costs. -->
  <!-- I estimate the structural model on linked Hungarian administrative data and use it to quantify the relative importance of each of these mechanisms. -->
  <!-- High-skill occupations offer higher wages and more stable employment but lower non-wage amenities than low-skill ones. -->
  <!-- Coupled with less frequent offers and higher costs of switching from low-skill to high-skill jobs, workers who start in high-skill occupations have much steeper wage profiles. -->
  <!-- I find that occupationally heterogeneous labor market frictions are the key determinants of ex ante wage profiles. -->
  <!-- These results indicate that occupational heterogeneity in the sources of wage inequality is instrumental to fully account for life cycle wage dynamics. -->

<!--   <p class=paperdet> <i> Abstract: </i>  -->
<!--   We propose a new method to estimate continuous-time job search models.  -->
<!-- Our approach is based on an adaptation of the conditional choice probability estimation methods to a continuous-time job search environment. To do so, the proposed framework incorporates preference shocks into the search framework, resulting in a tight connection between value functions and conditional choice probabilities.  -->
<!-- Our method, relative to standard estimation methods for continuous-time job search models, yields considerable computational gains.  -->
<!-- In particular, we can estimate rich nonstationary job search models without having to solve any differential equations, and in some cases even avoiding any optimization.  -->
<!-- We apply our method to analyze the effect of unemployment benefit expiration on the duration of unemployment and wages using rich longitudinal data from Hungarian administrative records. -->

  with `r coauthors["Maria Zhu","link"]`</p>
  <!-- <p class=paperdet> <i> Abstract: </i>  -->
  <!-- Which former coworkers help displaced workers find jobs?  -->
  <!-- We answer this question by studying occupational similarity in job finding networks.  -->
  <!-- Using matched employer-employee data from Hungary, this paper relates the unemployment duration of displaced workers to the employment rate of their former coworker networks.  -->
  <!-- Overall, while coworkers from all occupations are helpful in job finding, we find significant heterogeneity by occupation skill-level.  -->
  <!-- For workers in low-skill jobs, coworkers who worked in the same narrow occupation as the displaced worker are the most useful network contacts.  -->
  <!-- For workers in high-skill jobs, coworkers from different occupations are the most useful network contacts. -->
